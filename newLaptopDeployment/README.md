## New Laptop Deployment

This directory stores some guidelines to deploy a new laptop. 

This directory will show you how to set up your newly purchased laptop to avoid being ripped off by various computer repair shops. 

Think twice before getting your computer repaired at an unofficial computer repair shop. Most of them: 

1) exaggerate the problems with your computer, 
2) deny your correct understanding, 
3) charge additional fees for labor only during the settlement, 
4) use deceptive tactics, 
5) inflate prices, and
6) verbally abuse customers, 

all of which are ways to rip you off. Only Chinese guidelines are provided in detail.
